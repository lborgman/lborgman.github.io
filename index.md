# List of PWA:s

## Compass
([Open](https://lborgman.github.io/compass/compass.html))
Can you write a compass app as a PWA?

## Hour Number
([Open](https://lborgman.github.io/hour/hour.html))
A little toy to impress on your friends... or not.

## Mindmap 4 Internet
([Open](https://lborgman.github.io/mm4i))
I would describe it as a rather full grown mindmap app.
Please test and give me some feedback about what I aught to change.

> *Tip:* If you are developing web sites there might be some es6 module for you in the repository.

## Mobile output for "Google Doc - Published to Web"
([Open](https://lborgman.github.io/responsiveGDoc/responsiveGDoc.html))
Google Doc has a feature "Publish to Web". This is excellent. Except that the web page has an old format that does not fit mobiles. This utility tries to fix that.
